# Undies for Me
 Give and autoequip underwear for player after first load

Check Build Folder for packaged mod.


Purpose

Comes with Default player underwear for male PCs (Vanilla Body) and female player characters (CBBE Curvy). Players can change default underwear by following the instructions below to best fit their chosen bodies. After character creation, your character will automatically be equipped with removable underwear. This means if you remove your armor, you won't be immediately nude. You can still remove your underwear to be fully naked. 
Please read further below if you wish to replace the bodies.


Instructions (Draft)

Comes with Default player underwear for male PCs (Vanilla Body) and female player characters (CBBE Curvy). To replace...
1) Download whatever modded underwear you want for your preferred body. Install mod per the author's instructions.
2) Copy and rename the nif files for the underwear you wish to replace. For the male underwear (size 0 and 1) rename to UndiesForMe_Male_0 and UndiesForMe_Male_1. Place into ...\Undies for Me\meshes\ . For the female underwear, repeat the same procedure but rename UndiesForMe_Female_0 and UndiesForMe_Female_1. 
3) If the author of the underwear has tagged the underwear as body slot 52, you are all set. If not, you need to open the nifs and change the bodyslot to 52. See this tutorial for an example. (((INSERT TUTORIAL HERE))) 
Do not change the texture paths - you want it to point to the mod you got the underwear from.
